# The Endurance Run - Python Console Game

A simple, text-based running/dodging game written in Python. The goal is to survive the clock by quickly and correctly typing the "run" command for each level.

## Features

* **Difficulty Scaling:** The game difficulty changes per level by adjusting the required input speed.
* **Levels:** The game progresses through 5 predefined levels with varying difficulty.
* **Console-Based:** No external libraries (like Pygame) are needed; only standard Python modules (`time`, `random`).

## How to Play

1.  Make sure you have Python installed.
2.  Save the `game.py` file.
3.  Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    python game.py
    ```
4.  Follow the prompts and try to type the required command ('r', 'run', or 'go') quickly before time runs out!
